Responsive Side Navigation Bar in HTML CSS & JavaScript.

A sidebar is the combination of various navigation links that align on the web page's right or left side and helps to faster move from one web page to another to the users. The main purpose to create a sidebar is for small sizes screen devices like tablets, mobile.

There is only one difference between the side navigation bar and the navigation bar is, the navigation bar is a large screen size device like a laptop, computer, and side navigation from small sizes devices. Actually, we convert the navigation menu to the side navigation menu.

I have uploaded one image of the side navbar design that we are going to create. We can include or add various navigation links, logos,s and social media icons inside the sidebar. To make the sidebar fixed while scrolling we just add the following codes:
position: fixed;
left or right: 0px; (where you want to keep)
top: 0px;
height: 100vh;
width: as your need for example: 250px;
