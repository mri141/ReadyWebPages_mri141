Dropdown Sidebar Menu using HTML CSS & JavaScript

Sidebar means the section on the website that is located on the right or left side with some important navigation links and the user can open or close it. Dropdown menu means that sub-menu or nav links which are hidden in very first but when user do hover or click on the main nav link then sub-menu appears.

There are various ways to create a drop-down navigation menu. I think the following are the best and easy ways:

In HTML:
Make <ul> </ul> tag as a parents for the main navigation links.
Inside the <ul> </ul> tag add <li> </li> tag like this <ul><li>Home</li></ul>
Now for submenu add  <ul> </ul> tag again inside the <li> </li> like this:
<ul><li>Home
 <ul>
  <li>Sub Menu</li>
  </ul>
</li></ul>
