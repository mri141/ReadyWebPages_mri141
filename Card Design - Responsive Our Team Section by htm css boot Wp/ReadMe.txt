Responsive Profile Card Slider in HTML CSS

Profile Card means the identity card of a particular person that contains some details of them like name, job position, and some other information. On the web pages, we can see various people's profile cards with different designs. The main motive to append profile cards on the webpage is to make users contact the person easily.

Here is an image of the profile card that I have uploaded on the webpage. Basically, profile cards look like this. As you can see there is a different image on the top and a person's name their job and some media icon to contact them through social media.

 At the bottom of those cards, there are two buttons, that left side button is active so its width increase, when we clicked on the second button those three profile cards moves left side and another three cards appear smoothly. 

To see the actual sliding animation of the card and other hover effects of these profile cards, you can watch a full video tutorial of this program, and also you will get the concept of every code that I have used in these profile cards.
