I have provided essential tips tricks, articles, and tutorials to create a fully responsive footer as images.
Hello Readers, welcome to my other blog, today in this blog I'm going to create a Responsive Footer in HTML CSS. Earlier I have shared How to create a Responsive Navigation Menu and now it's time to create a footer section.

What is Footer?
In simple language, the footer is a section or full box which exists at the bottom of any type of webpages with important hyperlinks, information, and message or subscribe box. Footer is the most important section for all the websites. Footer can be depended upon the types of the webpage.
As you can see on the given image of the footer design that I have given on the webpage. Many people are confused about what they need to put inside the footer. We can put essential quick links, logo our privacy policy link, and copyright message. We can also add our social media icon inside the footer. By adding these types of elements we can make a good footer.

For the footer or any type of design we should add code inside the body tag, we have a separate tag for the footer as the name of the footer. We have to add HTML code for the footer inside the footer tag. To get the footer stick to the bottom we have to give the following CSS.

position: fixed;
width: 100%;
left: 0px;
bottom: 0px;
From the CSS media query, we can make the footer fully responsive, you can watch on the video tutorial how we can make the footer responsive in just seconds.
